# Elevator System (Java)

## Description
This project is a simple simulation of an elevator system implemented in Java.
It demonstrates how an elevator processes floor requests and moves between floors
using basic programming logic and Java collections.

---

## Features
- Elevator movement between floors
- Handling multiple floor requests
- Queue-based request processing
- Console output showing elevator actions

---

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Collections (ArrayList / Queue)

---

## How It Works
1. The user or system provides a list of floor requests.
2. The elevator processes the requests one by one.
3. The elevator moves up or down depending on the target floor.
4. The current floor is updated and displayed in the console.

---

## Example
The program outputs elevator movement step by step, showing:
- Current floor
- Target floor
- Direction of movement

---

## Purpose
This project was created as a university assignment to practice:
- Working with collections
- Basic system simulation logic in Java
